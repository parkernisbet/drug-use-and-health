# Drug Use and Health
This project covers two separate drug use related insights: drug use trends as a function of earliest age of consumption, and the impact of drug use on mental health. At the time of writing, only the first insight has been completed and uploaded to Github.

The health data used herein was sourced from National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports, spanning 2002 to 2018. Additional information (source overview and survey background) can be found [here](https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/homepage.cfm) and [here](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-nid13517), respectively.

### Drug Use and Age Trends
A brief look at drugs use trends as a function of earliest age of consumption. In particular, this highlights an overall trend of individuals waiting until later in life before experimenting with drugs. The only drug to not strictly follow this pattern was inhalants, seeing slight net-positive change to for abusers under the age of 10.

### Impact of Drugs on Mental Health
Pending completion.
